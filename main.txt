Installing on Windows
There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. 
The most official build is available for download on the Git website. 
Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. 
Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.
